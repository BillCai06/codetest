The drone's round-trip range is defined by the cumulative distance it can traverse from any point on the circumference of a circle to the circle's center and back to any point on the circumference. This total distance also includes the fixed distance utilized by the drone to perform any tasks at the circle's center.

```python
import math

def drone_round_trip_range(radius, task_distance):
    """
    Function to calculate the drone's round-trip range.

    Parameters:
    radius (float): The radius of the circle, represents the distance from any point on the circumference to the center.
    task_distance (float): The fixed distance used by the drone to perform any tasks at the center of the circle.

    Returns:
    float: The drone's round-trip range.

    # Calculate the distance from a point on the circumference to the center and back to any point on the circumference
    circumference_to_center_distance = 2 * radius

    # Add the task distance to calculate the total round-trip range
    total_distance = circumference_to_center_distance + task_distance

    return total_distance

# Test the function
radius = 10  # Radius of the circle
task_distance = 2  # Fixed distance to perform tasks at the center
