Consider an environment with $n$ distinct targets that require surveillance. The objective is to deploy one combination of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) to efficiently survey these targets. The mission has one primary constraint $E!=0$ and one optimization constraints total time $T$.
