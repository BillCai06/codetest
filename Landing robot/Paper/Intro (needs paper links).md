Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable across a plethora of applications, from surveillance and package delivery to infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and precision agriculture. Their potential is especially significant for the continuous monitoring of dynamic environments, such as air quality sampling, border security, and the visual inspections of power plants and pipelines. In these persistent surveillance tasks, UAVs are constantly navigating the environment to ensure high-quality or frequent sensor measurements in specified regions. Given this continuous operation, the limited battery life of UAVs becomes an even more significant constraint, prompting the need for trajectories optimized for prolonged mission durations.

This battery limitation significantly hampers the overall capabilities of UAVs. Addressing this challenge, a substantial body of research has emerged. Solutions proposed include novel energy harvesting designs, automated battery swapping mechanisms, energy-efficient low-level controllers, tactical low-level path planning, and charging through Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). Alongside, there's been a distinct emphasis on high-level path planning, with a focus on energy optimization, especially when integrating UAVs with UGV charging systems. However, many of these efforts overlook the energy demands of the UGVs themselves. Our research aims to rectify this oversight, adopting a comprehensive approach that takes into account the energy requirements of both UAVs and UGVs.
